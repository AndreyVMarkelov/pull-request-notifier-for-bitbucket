If things don't work as you expect, perhaps you should file an issue. But first, try troubleshooting it and provide as much info as possible. Here are some things that may help if added to an issue.

 * Plugin version used.
 * Bitbucket Server version used.
 * Stack traces in Bitbucket Server log file.
 * Any browser console log messages, you can find it in Developer Tools in Chome by pressing F12.
 * Screenshot of plugin configuration in your issue. Or the actual persisted settings:
 * Your configuration:
   * http://localhost:7990/bitbucket/rest/prnfb-admin/1.0/settings
   * http://localhost:7990/bitbucket/rest/prnfb-admin/1.0/settings/buttons
   * http://localhost:7990/bitbucket/rest/prnfb-admin/1.0/settings/notifications
 * If the system you are trying to notify does not seem to get notified:
  * Check that the triggered URL looks as expected. You can do that by invoking https://requestb.in/ and inspect its results.
  * Try to SSH to the Bitbucket Server machine and run same URL with Curl to make sure it's not a firewall issue.
