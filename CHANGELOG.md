# Pull Request Notifier for Stash Changelog

Changelog of Pull Request Notifier for Stash.

## 1.3
Same as version 1.2 but with different version number. When version 1.2 was initially rejected I fixed the issue and created a new 1.2. But a new version number was needed for a resubmission to Atlassian Marketplace.

## 1.2
* Compatible with Java 7, was compatible with Java 8 since java.util.Base64 was accidently used

## 1.1
* Adding support for filters
* Adding support for PULL_REQUEST_TO_HASH and PULL_REQUEST_FROM_HASH variables
* Fixing authentication bug
* Making it compatible with Stash 2.12.0

## 1.0
Initial Release
